                Figure 2 illustrates the basic architecture of the social interaction interface and how it communicates with the interactive storytelling system. 
                The Storytelling Server gener-ates and controls the execution of the stories, administrates multiple clients who share the same  narrative,  
                and informs the Social Interaction Server about valid  suggestions for the next  chapters.  The Social  Interaction  Server  is the  interface  
                between interac-tive storytelling  system  and  social network. It  is  responsible  for accessing the  social networks  looking  for  user interactions, 
                 translating the  users  desires  into  valid story suggestions, and informing the  Storytelling Server  about  the  user’s  choices.  
                 The  Cli-ent  Drama  Viewer  is  responsible  for  simply  displaying  the  generated  plots  to  the viewers. Users can access the social networks using
                their own social network applica-tions.  The  interaction  system  also  has  a  special  page  in the  social networks.  Users who  want  to  participate
                 and  interact  with  the  story  must  “follow”  (Twitter  and Google+) or “like”  (Facebook) this  page,  so they are able to receive the  update
                 mes-sages from the interaction system.
